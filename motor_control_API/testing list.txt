AGV MotorController testing:

RasbPi	- Use as SW programmer
	- Use as I2C master to call movement functions
	- Use as I2C slave to return current speed as if from encoders

Tests:
- Perfect speed (no PI)
	forward, straight line
	backward, straight line
	forward, loose arc
	backward, loose arc
	forward, tight arc
	backward, tight arc
	inPlace, left
	inPlace, right
- speeding up (reduce speed with PI)
	same tests
- slowing down (increase with PI)
	same tests
- alternating speeds (random PI correction)
- interrupting execution with another instruction
- sending incorrect instructions
	negative speed
	negative distance (maybe use neg-pos as forward/backward)
	negative direction (maybe use neg/pos as left/right)
